People are those belonging to a place, religion, nation, race, language, class or culture. An example of people is those living on the east coast. An example of people is Christians. An example of people is Italians.
So basically, both person and people can be used as singular nouns, people can be used as a plural noun and persons and peoples are also acceptable plural forms.
When using third person or "non-first-person" pronouns during self-talk, you do not use pronouns such as I, me, or my. Instead, you speak to yourself (either in a hushed tone or silently inside your own head) using pronouns such as you, he, she, it, or your own first or last name.

The noun person has two plurals: persons and people. Most people don't use persons, but the sticklers say there are times when we should. Or if we know the exact number, we'd say ninety-eight persons were there.
Some people find that speaking in third person improves their self-esteem, their ability to perform well under stress, to manage their emotions more favorably, and to think through complex situations in a more rational and calm manner.
In writing, the first person point of view uses the pronouns “I,” “me,” “we,” and “us,” in order to tell a story from the narrator's perspective. The storyteller in a first-person narrative is either the protagonist relaying their experiences or a peripheral character telling the protagonist's story.

n one study, they found that third person self talk could help people manage the emotional distress that accompanies public speaking. They've also found that distanced self talk can be effective for people with social anxiety, who can be especially prone to stress and struggle with emotional regulation.
